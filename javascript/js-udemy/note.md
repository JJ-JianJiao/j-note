1. JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, muulti-paradigm programming language.
	* high-level: we do not have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
	* object-oriented: based on objects, for storing most kinds of data
	* multi-paradigm: use different styles of programming. ex: imperative and declarative programming.    
2. html - nouns, css - adjectives, js - verbs    
3. declare: 声明
4. value:    
	1. Object
	2. Primitive
		* number: floaing point numbers ```let age = 23;```
		* string: sequene of characters ```let firstName = 'Jonas';```
		* boolean: logical type that can only be true or false ```let fullAge = true;```
		* undefind: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value') ```let children;```
		* null: also means 'empty value'
		* symbol(ES2015): value that is unique and cannot be changed [not sueful for now]
		* Bigint(ES2020): larger integers than the Number type can hold
	>!important: Javascript has dynamic typing: we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.    
5. let and const are introduced in ES6.    
6. quotation mark: ', ". Backticks: `.    
7. 5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN
