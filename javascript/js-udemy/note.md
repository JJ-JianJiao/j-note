2. JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, muulti-paradigm programming language.
   - high-level: we do not have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
   - object-oriented: based on objects, for storing most kinds of data
   - multi-paradigm: use different styles of programming. ex: imperative and declarative programming.
3. html - nouns, css - adjectives, js - verbs
4. declare: 声明
5. value:
   1. Object
   2. Primitive
      _ number: floaing point numbers `let age = 23;`
      _ string: sequene of characters `let firstName = 'Jonas';`
      _ boolean: logical type that can only be true or false `let fullAge = true;`
      _ undefind: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value') `let children;`
      _ null: also means 'empty value'
      _ symbol(ES2015): value that is unique and cannot be changed [not sueful for now] \* Bigint(ES2020): larger integers than the Number type can hold
      > !important: Javascript has dynamic typing: we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically.

7. quotation mark: ', ". Backticks: `.
8. 5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN
