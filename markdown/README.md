# Markdown Basics:
1. All Original Syntax
2. Headings. the max header tag in html is six, same as markdown
  a. format :
      Header 1
      =========
      Header 2
      ---------

  b. format:
    # header 1
    ## header 2
    ### header 3
    ...
    ###### header 6
3. Paragraph Text & Emphasis
  a. in some cases if we want to change the new line, it needs to hit two "enter" key.
  b. Emphasis:
    (1) Italy:
      * _content_ : underscore the contents
      * *content* : asterisk the contents
    (2) Strong:
      * __Strong__: two underscore
      * **Strong**: two asterisk
NOTE: in programming code, for example the variable name : var_example_int, the "_" will name the content inside became the Italy. To Avoid this, we should add \ before the _.  Like this: var\_example\_int. But some of the markdown version does not allow this, so we should use * more than _.

4. Quotes & Code Blocks
  Quotes:
    a. > is for the quote
    b. >> is for the child of the quote
  Code Blocks
    a. \``content`\` will show like the inline code
    b. ```content``` will show the multiple line of code blocks

5. Lists
6. Links, Images, & More
